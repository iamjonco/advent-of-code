# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. Working through 2020 and previous years when I
have the time.

This repo also allows me to experiment with new coding practices including:

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#specification) - commit message
  standardisation
- [Pip-Tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) - better pip requirements management
